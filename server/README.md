# IMS
Information management system. The API is the database!

## Concept
The concept of this project is to create a system that can be used to manage information. Everything is an object in a system. An object contains a header and zero or many entities. To contain an entity it must implement the interface of an entity. An object can be accessed by an API endpoint. The endpoint can be the IMS server or an external service. The IMS server serves as a gateway to access every object.
